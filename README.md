# Data Mining with Weka

OVERVIEW
--------------------------------------------------
This project aims to study data mining through analysing a database with the machine learning software Weka. The project was made for the [Artificial Intelligence] course. It was made at the Computer Science undergraduate program from University of SÃ£o Paulo (ICMC - USP).

WHICH DATABASE WAS USED?
--------------------------------------------------
The data base deals with the "Alcohol consumption by students of the subjects of Mathematics and Portuguese language of high school (secondary school or high school)". The database was obtained from the following repository:
* <http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/STUDENT+ALCOHOL+CONSUMPTION>

Possible useful knowledge to be taken from the database
--------------------------------------------------
```bash
- What is the relation between the number of hours of study and the consumption of alcohol by students?
- Do parents 'schooling influence the students' alcohol consumption?
- Does the level of frequency of outings with friends influence alcohol consumption?
- Does free time, ie no class, have an impact on alcohol consumption?
- Does the quality of the relationship with the family have an impact on alcohol consumption? Does the number of absences at school have anything to do with alcohol consumption?
- Does the time to get to school have an influence on alcohol consumption?
- Do students from urban area consume more alcohol than rural area students?
```

MOTIVATION
--------------------------------------------------
Will alcohol consumption by Secondary School students influence their school performance and social life?

DATA DESCRIPTION AND ATTRIBUTES
--------------------------------------------------
There are 32 related attributes in the database. The description of each field and the values they can receive are in English so that we do not lose the reference of the database content, but will be effectively discussed in Portuguese during the course of the parts of the work.
Detailed information about the attributes can be found in the file: `project report.pdf`.

FILES
--------------------------------------------------
The database files are to be found in the folder: `base_dados-original`
Through the database, it was possible to generate (.arff) files which can be opened and analyse with Weka software.
